  Evaluate any project against fixed "Hon Maguro" quality bars via bin/maguro (init/links/eval), run Lighthouse median-of-3 for SCORE1, and optionally a capped fix loop (max 2 rounds). Binary pass/fail — no partial credit. Use when the user says "eval this project", "hon maguro", "quality bar check", "is this project ready", "audit code quality", "lighthouse", "pagespeed", "fix until pass", "inspect and fix", or wants a pass/fail quality verdict against fixed standards.

# hon-maguro

Binary quality gate: a project either meets every fixed bar (**HON MAGURO**) or it **Fails**. No partial credit. Bars → `STANDARDS.md`. Anti-gaming → `MEET.md`.

`bin/maguro` is a self-contained Bash CLI (curl + python3 only). Scripts live next to this skill when installed from the repo.

## Invoke

```bash
bin/maguro eval  <path>   # full eval — writes HON-MAGURO-EVAL-REPORT.md
bin/maguro init  <path>   # drop blank HON-MAGURO-EVAL.md
bin/maguro links <path>   # SCORE3 only (curl, no install)
bin/maguro help

bin/lighthouse-median <url> [runs]   # SCORE1: Performance median of 3 (=100 to pass)
```

Typical flow:
1. `bin/maguro init <path>` — blank EVAL form (bar IDs + evidence cells).
2. Fill each evidence cell with a **number, count, or binary** (never prose).
3. For web UIs: `bin/lighthouse-median <url>` → paste Performance median into `SCORE1`.
4. `bin/maguro eval <path>` — per-bar table + verdict + fail tips.

## What `eval` checks

- **Auto:** `CODE3` (strict + 0 `any`), `REPO1` (secrets), `REPO2` (deps ≤20), `SCORE3` (links).
- **HUMAN (evidence required):** SPEED1–5, TEST1, SCORE1, SCORE2, DOCS1, CODE1, CODE2, REPO3, OPS1–6. Confirm against STANDARDS.md.

## Reading the output

- Status: `PASS` / `FAIL` / `HUMAN`.
- `result: HON MAGURO` only when FAIL=0 **and** HUMAN=0.
- On FAIL: **how to pass:** tips (also in `HON-MAGURO-EVAL-REPORT.md`).

## SCORE1 — Lighthouse

Bar: **Performance median of 3 runs = 100** (N/A if no web UI).

```bash
bin/lighthouse-median https://localhost:3000
bin/lighthouse-median https://myapp.com 3
```

- Shells out to `npx lighthouse` (no package.json dep); needs Node + Chrome; median via `python3`.
- Paste e.g. `Lighthouse perf median=100 (3 runs) — https://myapp.com` into SCORE1 evidence.
- Real product URL only; fix root cause — never suppress audits.

## Inspect → fix (capped, max 2 rounds)

Not open-ended. Infinite "until green" invites cheating the meter.

```bash
bin/maguro init  <path>   # if needed
bin/maguro eval  <path>   # round 0 baseline
# fix real FAILs (product, not meter)
bin/maguro eval  <path>   # round 1
# optional second fix
bin/maguro eval  <path>   # round 2 — last
```

**Stop when:** HON MAGURO · 2 fix cycles done · remaining is HUMAN/measure · only MEET-violating options left.

### Allowed fixes (product, not meter)

| FAIL | Honest fix |
|--|--|
| **CODE3** | `"strict": true`; replace `any` / `as unknown as` with `unknown` + narrowing |
| **REPO1** | Untrack `.env`; remove secret-shaped strings; rotate if real |
| **REPO2** | Drop unused deps; or one-line why for each past 20 in EVAL |
| **SCORE3** | Fix broken links (`maguro links`) |
| **TEST1** | Fix failures/flakes; add flow tests — never delete tests to go green |
| **DOCS1** | README alone boots a stranger (commands exit 0) |
| **CODE1/2** | Glossary↔schema 1:1; one auth path; 0 user-facing stack leaks |
| **SPEED\*** | Prefetch first; then real perf — measure every product URL |
| **SCORE1** | `bin/lighthouse-median`; fix root cause to median 100 |
| **SCORE2** | Fix React Doctor findings — don't disable rules |
| **OPS\*** | Real napkin/prod numbers; prove restore once |

### Forbidden (MEET)

- Secret eval mode / cherry-picked routes
- Suppress Lighthouse/Doctor/lint/tests to fake 100
- `@ts-ignore`, blanket `any`, delete tests, fake N/A
- Invent SPEED/OPS/Lighthouse numbers
- Loop past 2 fix rounds

### Report after fix rounds

```
rounds: <n>/2
result: HON MAGURO | FAIL
fixed: <bar ids>
still open: <FAIL + HUMAN needing measure>
next human step: <one line or none>
```

## Rules (MEET.md)

- Same path users take.
- Fix the product, not the meter.
- Named exception + measured number beats a fake pass.
